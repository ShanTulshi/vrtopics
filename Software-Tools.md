## Recommended VR world creation tools

We recommend Unity. Unity provides many introductory video tutorials, comprehensive documentation, examples and additional downloadable assets.

* [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com/)

The unreal engine provides more customization and is often the graphics platform used in award winning games, however it has a larger learning curve and requires some C++ knowledge to program.

* [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/)

## Web-based VR development

"Aframe" is a great starting point to create Web-based VR experiences for a wide set of VR headsets and platforms

* https://aframe.io/

In addition to aframe's document a pleasant starting point is this introduction by [Viget](https://www.viget.com/articles/creating-your-first-webvr-app/)

There is the experimental Firefox API "webVR" -

* [Firefox WebVR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API)

Alternatively if you really want to build everything from first principles starting with just the 2D or 3D graphics then you could start with a 2D canvas element or the low level [webGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) graphics API.

## 3D model creation

Simple geometric objects can be created directly inside Unity and other graphical engines
downloaded from the the Unity asset store, or even found with a bit of web searching.

More complex objects can be created using the following free tools-

* [Google sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/) (free)
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (free) 

The following commercial software may be available for free at your school or the 30 day trial period for your modelling needs.

* [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview)
* [Autocad](https://www.autodesk.com/products) by Autodesk
* [3D Studio Max](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview)
