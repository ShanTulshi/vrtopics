The following questions are a review for the [Oculus VR Best Practices](https://developer.oculus.com/design/latest/concepts/book-bp/).

True or False? Incorporating resting positions into your VR experience may help minimize the fatigue users may feel during extended gameplay sessions.

Optimize your application for ___ load times. 

To prevent eyestrain due to Accomodation and Vergence mismatch, a menu should be placed at least ___ meters away

To reduce computational complexity of the scene, use ______ as alternatives to 3D rendering of small (distant) objects

True or False? It is okay to render Head-up display information with incorrect stereoscopic depth cues.

Targeting reticles should be rendered A) in front of the scene. or, B) by building the reticle at the same depth as the target object?

Important interactive and informative elements should placed in the user's ____________

A jet player looks down at the city far below. A racecar drive looks at the ground speeding past. Which one experiences greater optical flow?

Vection is a perception of _________ purely due to _______ cues.

True or False? A major source of VR sickness is vection.

A spinning VR experience that is accelerating while the player remains stationary would / would not  cause discomfort.

True or False? An unnaturally rapid transit causes more or less discomfort than a normal walking pace motion.

Which is more comfortable if the VR simulated motion follows actual physical location? Forward user movement or sideways lateral movement?

Naseua can be reduced using short VR locomotions that employ fade-outs and fade-ins and correlate with physcai motion.

True or False? Use a 1.5 ratio between linear position changes of the userâ€™s input controller and the corresponding movement of a hand in VR.

True or False? Menu items should be position where the user is looking.

True or False? Assign input controls to the right hand touch controller.

The current orientation of the input controller should be indicated using an ambient light source.

True or False? Good hand registration helps to avoid "uncanny hand valley" effect due to proprioceptive mismatch.

Preset fleshy, realistic hand models help users avoid the "uncanny hand valley" effect.

Small virtual hands are _____ than large virtual transparent hands.

Why may a VR system loose tracking when a user picks up objects off a virtual floor. 

Picking objects should allow objects to snap into the correct alignment if the object has one.

What is the concern if the grip button is used to release and throw an object in the virtual world?

Give three examples of how to spatialize a sound.

How should sounds change if the user rotates their head and is listening to sounds using a head mounted display with headphones?

True or False? Allow users to reset their origin point and orientation.

True or False? To prepare the user for the impending movement through the virtual environment, the movement is predicted by the user's avatar's motion. This will reduce discomfort.

Text should use a _______ font to ensure smooth rendering even when zoomed.

True or False? A 50 point font at 4.5m would be a comfortable reading experience for most users.

Flicker is the perception of ___________ and cause headaches or fatigue in some users.

Flicker is most noticeable in the _________ of the optical field.

True or False? Flicker effects can be reduced by using a brighter palette.

True or False?  Closely spaced high contrast bands of high contrast can cause flicker and even seizures.

_____ vertex mapping transforms the height position of a texture coordinates using a user-supplied height map.

_____ mapping provides depth and surface cues by effecting the specular lighting of the texture.

Is Normal or Parallax mapping preferred for VR applications? Why?

What five delays are included in the system Latency "motion to photon"?

While ideally latency would be zero,in practice, compelling VR should target a latency of ____ ms or less.

True or False? VR app designers need to consider the safety and comfort of the VR experience. 

True or False? VR app designers need to consider framing.
