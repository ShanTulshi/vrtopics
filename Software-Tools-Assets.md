# Software tools and assets

The following is a list of low-priced (often free) resources that can be great starting points for your adventures in creating VR content. 

## Recommended VR world creation tools

For beginners to VR development we recommend Unity. Unity provides many introductory video tutorials, comprehensive documentation, examples and additional downloadable assets. It includes a script programming interface and a drag and drop interface to create and populate your 3D world.

* [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com/)

The unreal engine provides more customization and is often the graphics platform used in award winning games, however it has a larger learning curve and requires some C++ knowledge to program.

* [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/)

## Web-based VR development

The "Aframe" projectis a great starting point to create Web-based VR experiences for a wide set of VR headsets and platforms

* https://aframe.io/

In addition to aframe's document a pleasant starting point is this introduction by [Viget](https://www.viget.com/articles/creating-your-first-webvr-app/)

There is the experimental Firefox API "webVR" -

* [Firefox WebVR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API)

Alternatively if you really want to build everything from first principles starting with just the 2D or 3D graphics then you could start with a 2D canvas element or the low level [webGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) graphics API.

## 3D model creation

Simple geometric objects can be created directly inside Unity and other graphical engines
downloaded from the the Unity asset store, or even found with a bit of web searching.

More complex objects can be created using the following free tools-

* [Google sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/) (free)
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (free) 

The following commercial software may be available for free at your school or the 30 day trial period for your modelling needs.

* [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview)
* [Autocad](https://www.autodesk.com/products) by Autodesk
* [3D Studio Max](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview)

# 3D models and textures

Free and paid resources can be found at [free3d.com](https://free3d.com/3d-models/) and the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/). There are many other free and paid resources just a quick web search away.

Simple 3D environments can greatly benefit from bumpmaps and textures. Again there are many resources which can be quickly found through a web search. In addition to the textures included in Unity example projects, high quality textures can be downloaded from [freestocktextures.com](https://freestocktextures.com/)

# Audio samples and resources

Free Sound effects can be found at [freesound](https://freesound.org/).

The BBC provides high quality [sound effects](http://bbcsfx.acropolis.org.uk/) freely licensed for personal, educational and research purposes.

# Audio editing

We recommends [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) a free audio editing tool.
